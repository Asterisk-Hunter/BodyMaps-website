// PLAN_LIMITS mirrors flask-server/services/plan_store.py. The server is what
// actually decides — it returns 402 with a reason, and that reason is what the
// upgrade dialog reports. This copy exists so the UI can grey a locked control
// out up front instead of letting you click into a rejection. A drift between
// the two is a cosmetic bug here and a real one there; change them together.
//
// Neither the plan nor the account type is stored here: both are columns on
// user_account and arrive through authContext. What's left in this file is the
// vocabulary — the ids, labels and limits the UI renders.
