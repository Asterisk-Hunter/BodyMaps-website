"""Product analytics: one row per tracked interaction.

Separate from ``usage_event`` on purpose. That table is load-bearing — plan
quotas are counted off it, so it stays narrow and every row is written by the
server as part of enforcing a limit. This one is the opposite: rows arrive from
the browser in batches, nothing depends on them, and losing a batch costs a
number on a dashboard rather than a wrong quota decision.

``user_id`` is nullable because signed-out visitors are tracked too, under
``anon_id`` (a random id kept in the browser's localStorage). Every row has an
``anon_id``; only signed-in rows also have a ``user_id``.

``plan`` and ``account_type`` are SNAPSHOTS, written by the server from the
account at the time the event lands, never taken from the request body. Two
reasons: the client must not be able to claim a plan it isn't on, and a user who
moves from free to pro shouldn't retroactively rewrite what their earlier
activity is attributed to. Both are null for anonymous rows.

The same goes for the location and device columns below. ``ip_address`` is the
address the request actually arrived from, the ``country_*``/``region``/``city``
/lat/lon fields are what GeoLite2 made of it, and ``device_type`` is read off
the User-Agent header — all written by the server, none of them accepted from
the event body. A client that could name its own country would make the map
fiction.

**``ip_address`` is personal data.** It is stored in full at the site owner's
decision, it is only ever exposed through the admin-only analytics endpoints,
and it is removed with the rest of the row when ``purge_old_events`` reaches the
retention window. Location is derived at write time so that reading the map
never needs the address.
